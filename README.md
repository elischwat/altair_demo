A demo for using altair with both wide and tidy form datasets. The demo is the notebook

altair-exploratory-notebook.ipynb

Datasets used in the demo are included in this repo.

Altair documentation:
https://altair-viz.github.io

To run the notebook, you can use your own environment and install the packages imported.

Or, you can use the environment provided here in the `environment.yaml`. 

I recommend you use `mamba` to install the environment,

https://mamba.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation.html

but `conda` will work find too.

Install the enivironment like so:

```
mamba env create -f environment.yaml
```
